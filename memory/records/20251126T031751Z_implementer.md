# Implementer Log — sim-eval live run (localhost:3000)
- Cleared simulation systems on the running sim-eval server (DELETE /api/simulation/system/system-{1..80}) and reset to zero systems.
- Registered Position and Velocity components plus BallSpawnerSystem, GravitySystem, MotionIntegrationSystem (modulePath under plugins/simulation/*.js).
- Ran the simulation and captured SSE frames to `workspaces/ball_is_dropped/verification/capture_live.jsonl` (filtered `data:` lines to NDJSON; trimmed initial cached frame).
- Updated verifier to support map-shaped entity payloads from SimEval streams and re-ran: all checks PASS on the live capture.
- Simulation stopped after capture; current system count is 3 (spawner, gravity, integration).
