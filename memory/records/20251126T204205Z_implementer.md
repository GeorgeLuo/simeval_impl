# Implementer Log — ball_is_dropped
- Set mindset: Implementer. Reviewed System/Component design docs and workspace README/world description to align with ball drop phenomena.
- Added simulation plugins under `workspaces/ball_is_dropped/src/plugins/simulation/` (Position, Velocity, Gravity components; BallSpawner, Gravity, MotionIntegration systems; lightweight world helper).
- Built an offline runner (`runner.js`) to step the simulation locally and emit frames (supports optional namespacing to mirror sim-eval streams); sample output matches provided captures.
- Added evaluation helpers under `workspaces/ball_is_dropped/src/plugins/evaluation/` to extract a vertical trace and judge release/descent/acceleration from streams.
- Updated workspace README with runner usage and re-ran `verification/verifier.sh` against the sample capture (still passes).
