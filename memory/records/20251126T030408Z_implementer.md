# Implementer Log — ball_is_dropped
- Set mindset: Implementer. Reviewed System/Component design docs; target phenomena from phenomener.
- Added simulation plugin scaffolding (Position, Velocity, Gravity components; gravity/integration/release systems; ball factory; runner helper) under `workspaces/ball_is_dropped/src/plugins/simulation/`.
- Added evaluation helper for descent verification under `workspaces/ball_is_dropped/src/plugins/evaluation/`.
- Generated sample capture (`verification/capture_sample.jsonl`) and confirmed `verification/verifier.sh` passes on it.
- Documented workspace layout and quick verification loop in `workspaces/ball_is_dropped/README.md`.
- Next: upload plugins to sim-eval, run real capture, iterate against verifier if stream schema differs.
