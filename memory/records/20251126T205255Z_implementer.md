# Implementer Log — sim-eval live run (localhost:3000)
- Uploaded ball drop plugins to the sim-eval server via `/codebase/plugin` (Position, Velocity, Gravity components; BallSpawner, Gravity, MotionIntegration systems using 0.1s tick step).
- Registered components and injected systems, then started simulation and captured 80 SSE frames to `workspaces/ball_is_dropped/verification/capture_live.jsonl` (fresh tick=0 stream).
- Ran `verification/verifier.sh` on the live capture — all checks PASS (release, descent, acceleration).
- Current server state: simulation idle with 3 systems loaded; evaluation player still running; components registered.
