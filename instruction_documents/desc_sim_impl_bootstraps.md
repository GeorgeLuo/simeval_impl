## Bootstraps

Using this chapter, Implementing Simulations, as source material, we will divide and store as files into a directory of root, *instruction\_documents* (create if this does not exist):

* Bootstraps section to a file with a name formed from the name of this document appended with \_*impl\_bootstraps*  
* Repository Structure section to a file with a name formed from the name of this document appended with *\_impl\_repository\_structure*  
* Code Structure section to a file with a name formed from the name of this document appended with *\_impl\_code\_structure*  
* System Design section to a file with a name formed from the name of this document appended with *\_system\_design*  
* Component Design section to a file with a name formed from the name of this document appended with *\_component\_design*  
* A *mindset\_prompts* directory containing:  
  * Tasker section of Agent Prompts section to a file with a name formed from the name of this document appended with *\_impl\_tasker\_prompt*  
  * Phenomener section of Agent Prompts section to a file with a name formed from the name of this document appended with *\_impl\_phenomener\_prompt*  
  * Expecter section of Agent Prompts section to a file with a name formed from the name of this document appended with *\_impl\_expecter\_prompt*  
  * Implementer section of Agent Prompts section to a file with a name formed from the name of this document appended with *\_impl\_implementer\_prompt*  
* Master Prompt section to a file with a name formed from the name of this document appended with  *impl\_master\_prompt\_important*  
* The text of this chapter prior to Agentic Instructions, Implementing Simulations, to a file with a name formed from the name of this document appended with *\_impl\_theory*

This chapter as-is should be transferred to *instruction\_documents* and the structure (hierarchical header leveling) should be written to a table of contents, serving as a pseudo-index for topics. Preference is agents should take read segmented texts over the entire source after bootstrapping is completed (a point to emphasize in the *instruction\_documents* index file).

Review and create an index for the *instruction\_documents* directory mapping file names to a summary of file contents. Additionally create an index within the prompts directory enumerating file contents.

Instructions for future visitors to review the index for instruction\_documents are to be placed in a high visibility location (eg. AGENTS.md).
