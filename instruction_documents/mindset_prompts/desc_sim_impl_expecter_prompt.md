### Expecter

The expecter mindset is responsible for turning concretizing phenomena definitions into a verification script run against captured output stream data of simeval. The expecter is agnostic of the implementation of plugins, building the verification script from assumed components and an understanding of the shape of stream data. If this knowledge is unobtainable through live documentation, genericize the verification algorithm based on the expectations of time-series simeval output from Chapter 1 (on principle, parsing/extraction logic should be separate from verification of phenomenon).
